* Tools you might want to consider bringing with you include a handsaw to cut your tree; gloves to protect your hands; a tarp to sit on and/or to move your tree once it's cut; and rope or straps to secure your tree to your vehicle.
* Be sure another tree has space to grow within 8 feet of the one you plan to cut. Choosing a tree from a densely forested area will give the remaining trees more space to grow.
* Be aware of where the tree will fall and please ensure all people and vehicles are out of the path of the falling tree.
* Cut the leftover branches from the stump and scatter them.
* Help keep road ditches functioning and keep debris off of, and away from, roadways (at least 50 feet).
