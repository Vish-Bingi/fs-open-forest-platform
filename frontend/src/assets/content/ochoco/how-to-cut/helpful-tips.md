* Be familiar with what types of trees on your forest make good Christmas trees.
* Make sure you’ve got all the tools you need. Usually a hand saw, gloves, tarp, and ropes or straps will do it!
* Move the snow away from the base of the tree to ensure you’re at the right stump height.
* Cut your tree a bit longer than you need so that you can make a fresh cut at home before placing it in water.
* Be aware of where the tree will fall when cutting.
