You can buy Christmas tree permits in person at Umatilla National Forest ranger district offices or at [local vendors](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD603154). Each district office has different hours during the Christmas tree cutting season. Call first to make sure someone is available to sell permits. All offices are closed on federal holidays.
